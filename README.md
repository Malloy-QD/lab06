# lab06-Bug-Hunt

This lab is to give you practice doing some unit testing. Your objective is the following:

Read the documentation for the provided Queue Interface and Queue implementation
Note, my Queue Implementation is NOT templated. It only contains ints
Create a test class that will have as many methods as you see fit to verify, using tests, that the Queue satisfies the requirements of being a Queue
In other words, it fulfills the promises made in its documentation
